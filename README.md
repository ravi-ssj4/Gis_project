# Traffic Congestion Prediction - GIS Project
There is an online shopping delivery person.

Everyday he has to visit several ‘n’ locations and deliver parcels.

We have congestion data* of 3 months of bangalore city.

Based on that data, we want to predict the optimal path which the delivery person should follow on that day, so that it takes minimum time to deliver all the parcels on that day.

We are assuming that in the optimal path calculation, the delivery person is taking ‘x’ minutes at each location to deliver the parcel, etc. If x varies, then optimal path will vary accordingly. Hence, at each location, we will dynamically predict the optimal path, using our Machine learning algorithm which we are going to train by the help of the previous historical data of 3 months as stated earlier.

When we go from one location to another, we are only considering those two locations and based on dynamic congestion we need to find optimal route between those two locations in real time.
